# Close-Group Authoritarian Climate & Intergroup Avoidance

**Author:** Javad Kouhestani

This repository contains the research paper **“Close-Group Authoritarian Climate and Intergroup Avoidance: A Moderated Mediation Study.”**

## Summary

The study investigates how perceived authoritarianism within close social groups (family and friends) relates to intergroup avoidance. It shows that:

- Close-group authoritarian climate is positively associated with intergroup avoidance  
- This relationship is partly mediated by individual authoritarianism  
- The indirect effect is stronger when individuals actively enact group norms

The findings extend prior research by demonstrating that close-group ideological climates shape intergroup attitudes not only in children and adolescents, but also in adults.

## Framework and Methods

- Theoretical grounding in Social Identity Theory and Right-Wing Authoritarianism  
- Cross-sectional survey design  
- Analysis using moderated mediation (PROCESS Model 8)
